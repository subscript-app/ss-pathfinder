//! An abstraction for reading resources.
//!
//! This accomplishes two purposes over just using the filesystem to locate shaders and so forth:
//!
//! 1. Downstream users of Pathfinder shouldn't be burdened with having to install the resources
//!    alongside their binary.
//!
//! 2. There may not be a traditional filesystem available, as for example is the case on Android.
